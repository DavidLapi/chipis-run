# Placeholder for Julia sprite
# This file serves as a placeholder for the actual julia.png sprite
# Students can replace this with a real sprite image

# Expected dimensions: 40x60 pixels (PLAYER_WIDTH x PLAYER_HEIGHT)
# Format: PNG with transparency support
# Style: Pixel art or simple cartoon character

# TODO 4: Replace this placeholder with actual sprite
# - Create or find a sprite for Julia (main character) (CHIPI BUENO)
# - Ensure proper dimensions match PLAYER_WIDTH and PLAYER_HEIGHT in settings.py
# - Add transparency (alpha channel) for better visual integration
