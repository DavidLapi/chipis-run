# Placeholder for throw sound effect
# This file serves as a placeholder for the actual throw.wav sound

# Expected format: WAV or OGG
# Duration: 0.1-0.3 seconds
# Style: Quick "whoosh" or "swish" sound for knife throwing

# TODO 4: Replace this placeholder with actual sound
# - Record or find a throwing sound effect
# - Keep it short and punchy
# - Ensure it's not too loud or distracting
# - Test with multiple rapid throws to ensure it doesn't overlap badly
