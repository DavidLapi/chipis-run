# Placeholder for hit/damage sound effect
# This file serves as a placeholder for the actual hit.wav sound

# Expected format: WAV or OGG
# Duration: 0.2-0.5 seconds
# Style: Impact sound when player takes damage

# TODO 4: Replace this placeholder with actual sound
# - Record or find a hit/impact sound effect
# - Should convey damage or collision
# - Not too harsh or unpleasant for repeated listening
# - Consider different sounds for shield hits vs actual damage
